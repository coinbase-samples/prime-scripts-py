# Purpose

This repository of Python scripts demonstrates various REST and WebSocket APIs supported by Coinbase Prime.

While originally designed to power the Coinbase Prime Workshop, these scripts will work on their own with proper API credentials.

Prime workshop link here: [https://prime.saworkshop.dev/](https://prime.saworkshop.dev/)

All scripts are written in Python3 and have been tested with versions that are not end of life.

## Installation

Simply clone the repo to run scripts from your command line.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coinbase-samples/prime-scripts-py
```

The two dependencies needed for these scripts are `requests` and `websockets`. This can be done easily with the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, these scripts make use of command line environment variables so that sensitive information does not need to be included in the scripts themselves. Update the following information and run from your command line or choose your favorite method of storing sensitive information to proceed.

```
export ACCESS_KEY=ACCESS_KEY_HERE
export PASSPHRASE=PASSPHRASE_HERE
export SIGNING_KEY=SIGNING_KEY_HERE
export PORTFOLIO_ID=PORTFOLIO_ID_HERE
export SVC_ACCOUNTID=SVC_ACCOUNTID_HERE
```
